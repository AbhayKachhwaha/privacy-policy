      <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
      <p>
        We believe your Information is no one else's. Your privacy is important
        to you and to us. So we'll ensure at all time that we protect the

        that indicates how frequently people use our platform. EBONY MARKET only
        uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and
        not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of
        aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of
        the Service or services so that we can make the Service appealing to as
        many customers as possible, and improve those services.

      <p>
        As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information
        to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We
        share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand
        how often people use their services and our Service, so that they, too,
        may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, EBONY MARKET
        never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that
        would identify you personally.

        or religious beliefs, political opinions, sex life, sexual orientation,
        trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and
        biometric data). We do not collect any information about criminal
        convictions and offences.
